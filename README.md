# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

#3. Creating a new Hardhat project
We'll install Hardhat using the Node.js package manager (npm), which is both a package manager and an online repository for JavaScript code.

You can use other package managers with Node.js, but we suggest you use npm 7 or higher to follow this guide. You should already have it if you followed the previous section's steps.

Open a new terminal and run these commands to create a new folder:
```shell
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
```


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
